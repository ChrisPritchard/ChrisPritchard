### ðŸ‘‹ Hi!

My name is Christopher Pritchard, and I work as a Virtual Security Architect at [Aura Information Security](https://www.aurainfosec.com) in Wellington, New Zealand.

I'm a former software developer who currently works in infosec. If you want more detail on that admittedly boring little snippet, I keep my [linkedin up to date](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopher-pritchard-a669b6a/).

I love programming, but my github portfolio really took off when, as a .NET developer, I learned F#. Something just clicked, and I threw myself into that language and community *hard* for a bit. Most of my work here is in F#, which is a truly beautiful language.

However, when I moved to Infosec, .NET didn't work as well just because its not as universal, and especially since a functional-first language like F# is not as intuitive as the 'standard' set of infosec languages like bash and python. It and C# also don't compile to single executables as of the time of writing without a bit of effort. Go is something I am writing more and more in, not just because it solves these problems but also because the philosophy of the language and concurrency are both quite appealing to me.

Most of my projects are utility functions, and few sample/reference projects, game attempts or game-adjacent attempts, and things I've forked to keep a copy of.

Enjoy, and if you have any questions of any nature, feel free to reach out. My personal email address is chrispritchard.nz@gmail.com
