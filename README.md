### ðŸ‘‹ Hi!

My name is Christopher Pritchard, and I work as a Virtual Security Architect at [Aura Information Security](https://www.aurainfosec.com) in Wellington, New Zealand.

Most of my projects are utility functions, and few sample/reference projects, game attempts or game-adjacent attempts, and things I've forked to keep a copy of. I mainly code in F# (and occasionally C#) and Go. Enjoy, and if you have any questions of any nature, feel free to reach out. My personal email address is [chrispritchard.nz@gmail.com](mailto:chrispritchard.nz@gmail.com).
