### ðŸ‘‹ Hi!

My name is Christopher Pritchard, and I work as a Security Architect at [Aura Information Security](https://www.aurainfosec.com) in Wellington, New Zealand.

Most of my projects are game attempts or game-adjacent tools, utility functions, a few sample/reference projects, and things I've forked to keep a copy of. I mainly code in [F#](https://fsharp.org/)  and [Go](https://golang.org/). Enjoy, and if you have any questions of any nature, feel free to reach out. My personal email address is [chris@grislygrotto.nz](mailto:chris@grislygrotto.nz).

I'm a big fan of the TryHackMe infosec learning platform. Find me on there as [Aquinas](https://tryhackme.com/p/Aquinas).

Like my stuff and want to encourage me to do more of it? Buy me a coffee! <script type='text/javascript' src='https://storage.ko-fi.com/cdn/widget/Widget_2.js'></script><script type='text/javascript'>kofiwidget2.init('Support Me on Ko-fi', '#29abe0', 'E1E3AKZ3H');kofiwidget2.draw();</script>
