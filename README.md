I currently work as a Security Architect at [Aura Information Security](https://www.aurainfosec.com) in Wellington, Aotearoa / New Zealand. My pronouns are He/Him.

Most of my projects are game attempts or game-adjacent tools, utility functions, a few sample/reference projects, and things I've forked to keep a copy of. I mainly code in [F#](https://fsharp.org/)  and [Go](https://golang.org/). Enjoy, and if you have any questions of any nature, feel free to reach out. My personal email address is [chris@grislygrotto.nz](mailto:chris@grislygrotto.nz).

I'm a big fan of the TryHackMe infosec learning platform. Find me on there as [Aquinas](https://tryhackme.com/p/Aquinas).

Like my stuff and want to encourage me to do more of it? Buy me a coffee!
