### ðŸ‘‹ Hi!

My name is Christopher Pritchard, and I work as a Security Architect at [Aura Information Security](https://www.aurainfosec.com) in Wellington, New Zealand.

Most of my projects are game attempts or game-adjacent tools, utility functions, a few sample/reference projects, and things I've forked to keep a copy of. I mainly code in [F#](https://fsharp.org/)  and [Go](https://golang.org/). Enjoy, and if you have any questions of any nature, feel free to reach out. My personal email address is [chris@grislygrotto.nz](mailto:chris@grislygrotto.nz).

I'm a big fan of TryHackMe, too, find me on there as [Aquinas](https://tryhackme.com/p/Aquinas).
